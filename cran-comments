> Missing Rd-tags:

Section added.

> Examples for unexported function
> lgamma_vec() in:

>     action_migrate.Rd

lgamma_vec() does not appear in any of the listed examples. However, based on the listed examples the test is objecting to occurences of '~g3_param(...)'.
These examples have been reworked to remove this.

==== 0.8-3

Resubmission of new package after comments from CRAN team:

> Please always write package names, software names and API (application programming interface) names in single quotes in title and description. e.g: --> 'R','C++'

Done.

> Please add the references to your description (i.e. in DESCRIPTION) text

Added references to the 'Description' field

> You have examples for unexported functions.

* Removed gadget3:::step_find_desc() from vignettes
* gadget3:::stock_instance Now public, as g3_stock_instance
* gadget3:::g3_native now public
* gadget3:::g3_global_formula now public
* gadget3:::g3_step now public

> Please ensure that your functions do not write by default or in your examples/vignettes/tests in the user's home filespace (including the package directory and getwd())

g3_tmb_adfun() defaults to 'work_dir = tempdir()', so agreed that explicit 'work_dir = tempdir()' in examples shouldn't be necessary.
